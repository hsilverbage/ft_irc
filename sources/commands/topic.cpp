TOPIC message

     Command: TOPIC
  Parameters: <channel> [<topic>]

The TOPIC command is used to change or view the topic of the given channel. If <topic> is not given, either RPL_TOPIC or RPL_NOTOPIC is returned specifying the current channel topic or lack of one. If <topic> is an empty string, the topic for the channel will be cleared.

If the client sending this command is not joined to the given channel, and tries to view itsâ€™ topic, the server MAY return the ERR_NOTONCHANNEL (442) numeric and have the command fail.

If RPL_TOPIC is returned to the client sending this command, RPL_TOPICWHOTIME SHOULD also be sent to that client.

If the protected topic mode is set on a channel, then clients MUST have appropriate channel permissions to modify the topic of that channel. If a client does not have appropriate channel permissions and tries to change the topic, the ERR_CHANOPRIVSNEEDED (482) numeric is returned and the command will fail.

If the topic of a channel is changed or cleared, every client in that channel (including the author of the topic change) will receive a TOPIC command with the new topic as argument (or an empty argument if the topic was cleared) alerting them to how the topic has changed. If the <topic> param is provided but the same as the previous topic (ie. it is unchanged), servers MAY notify the author and/or other users anyway.

Clients joining the channel in the future will receive a RPL_TOPIC numeric (or lack thereof) accordingly.
